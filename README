    Rename to Devel::SizeMe
    Devel::SizeMe::Core - loads XS and sets options
    Devel::SizeMe - loads XS
        -d:SizeMe=opts
    Devel::SizeMe::Stream - parse raw stream
    Devel::SizeMe::Store - db write
    Devel::SizeMe::Data - db read / orlite?
    Devel::SizeMe::Graph - data reading/processing for sizeme_graph
    sizeme_store
    sizeme_graph
    tests
    Add R(un) and E(nd) tokens
    Support multiple runs
    Name runs to allow total_size (for example) of multiple data structures

Optimizations:
    Remove depth from stream?
Future
    Add addr to leaf to visualize memory layout
    Add token for ptr to node already seen (identified by addr I presume)
        so we can move from a Tree to a DAG and see alternative name paths.

Devel::Memory - Perl extension for finding the memory usage of Perl variables

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Devel::Memory qw(size total_size);

  my $size = size("A string");
  my @foo = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
  my $other_size = size(\@foo);
  my $total_size = total_size( $ref_to_data );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Acts like Devel::Size 0.77 is the PERL_DMEM env var is not set.

Except that it also provides perl_size() and heap_size() functions.

If PERL_DMEM env var is set to an empty string then all the *_size functions
dump a textual representation of the memory data to stderr.

If PERL_DMEM env var is set to a string that starts with "|" then the
remainder of the string is taken to be a command name and popen() is used to
start the command and the raw memory data is piped to it.

If PERL_DMEM env var is set to anything else it is treated as the name of a
file the raw memory data should be written to.

The dmemtree.pl script can be used to process the raw memory data.
Typically run via the PERL_DMEM env var. For example:

    export PERL_DMEM='|./dmemtree.pl --text'
    export PERL_DMEM='|./dmemtree.pl --dot=dmemtree.dot'
    export PERL_DMEM='|./dmemtree.pl --db=dmemtree.db'

The --text output is similar to the textual representation output by the module
when the PERL_DMEM env var is set to an empty string.

The --dot output is suitable for feeding to Graphviz.

The --db output is a SQLite database. (Very subject to change.)

Example usage:

  PERL_DMEM='|./dmemtree.pl --db=dmemtree.db' perl -MDevel::Size=:all -e 'total_size(sub { })'

The dmemview.pl script is a Mojolicious::Lite application that serves data to
an interactive treemap visualization of the memory use. It can be run as:

    dmemview.pl daemon

and then open http://127.0.0.1:3000
