*** Random TODOs:

See https://github.com/timbunce/devel-sizeme/issues

Integrate changes back into Devel::Size so we can share a common core.

Add ref count handling, per https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79789
Output addr as a leaf of a link node for items not scanned due to ref cnt
    render those as dotted lines on the graph visualization
    (and thus change from a tree to a DAG) so we can see alternate paths.

Optionally add addr to all nodes to enable visualization of actual memory layout

Restructure:
    Devel::SizeMe::Core - loads XS and sets options
    Devel::SizeMe - loads Devel::SizeMe::Core
        -d:SizeMe=opts?
    Devel::SizeMe::Stream - parse raw stream
    Devel::SizeMe::Store - db write
    Devel::SizeMe::Data - db read / orlite?
    Devel::SizeMe::Graph - data reading/processing for sizeme_graph
    sizeme_store - script wrapper for Devel::SizeMe::Store
    sizeme_graph - Mojolicious app wrapper using Devel::SizeMe::Graph
Move Devel::SizeMe::Graph and co out to separate distro.

Link and item names should match perlguts/perlapi names.

Tests!
hv placeholders
[ 1 => [] ]
$x=[]; push @$x, $x; total_size($x); # loop

Visualization should show refs to SVs that weren't counted.

Remove log scale checkbox from the treemp as it doesn't work yet

Reduce data volume to optimize usage and visualizations
    ideally as an optional post-processing on the db tables
    drop he+hek detail?
        perhaps by adding a size to links to represent the hidden sizes
    drop SV(RV) detail
        for cases where there's only a single ref to the SV(RV)
    prune
        bottom up delete nodes below a certain size
    enable control of level of detail
        cop_file as node or as attribute?
        he/hek etc as node or as attribute (if note shared)?

Docs
    note TARG effect on total_size([[]]) not counting the inner ref due to refcnt
